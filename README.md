# uav-image-segmentation

Developing an image detection (bounding box) and image segmentation (pixel mask) ML model using 200GB UAV footage dataset from RISEx competition.

Here;s what I've tried so far:

- fine tuning "Faster R-CNN" model from PyTorch library
- basic linear interpolation between bounding box ground truth frames

  As you can see, not that crazy, just learning to use Google CoLab so I don't have to drop 4k on a 4090 lol.

  Next, I'll be trying out the Yolo11 models, heard good things from my labmates.
